                    <h1> My Story</h1>
                    Coming from rural Ireland, I've worked diligently and simulataneously at many jobs to support myself throughout my education,
                    from waitressing and bartending to business development, art class assistant, Maths tuition and cutting turf (the Irish will know!).
                    My commitment to each role has been duly recognised by my employeers and although many have looked for me to return over the years,
                    it was the offer to step into full time software development with Breakthrough Maths that peaked my interest. Although I had learnt
                    some coding in my Engineering degrees, I had no experience in web development, yet the challenge excited me. I had never even heard of
                    ClojureScript or React a year ago, or even used IDEs such as VS Code, but now I have the confidence and assurance in my abilities to
                    produce new suites of components, design and work with extremely nested data structures, build and maintain code. ClojureScript is a
                    functional, lisp based language that may not be widely used, however it is my belief that a good software engineer should be able to
                    adapt to or learn any language, a skill which over the past year I've proven myself willing to do, and at considerable pace.
                    I am driven, hardworking, excited in the face of a challenge and relentless in the pursuit of personal improvement.

                <h1> My Next Chapter...?</h1>
                I am looking for a new role in the tech sector. Ideally I would be working in a software development role focusing on FE development,
                but I am keen to further the BE skills I had began to develop in my last role; thus I would love a job where I had the opportunity to
                work on both. I'm a major fan of the start-up scene and the wealth of knowledge that is be to gained from it, but I'm open to
                exploring how SME, MME and larger corporations operate.

                <p class="hidden">Although these works were centered around materials, I particularly enjoyed other modules I took such as computational engineering, thermodynamics and thermofluids,
                    matlab based projects, probability and statistics, electronics and user centered design for innovation.

                   team created by our CEO TJ, the company ethos and their desire to create real change in the world of Maths education, I quickly rose through the ranks; from hand
                   cranking slide decks to building software with the power to generate more engaging content and much, much more. Now our platform works to provide kids learning maths
                   with a pedagogically curated way of approaching Maths, with engagment throughout each step at it's core. Despite having already taught almost 8000 students on a weekly
                   basis in Ireland, the real end goal of this company is still being realised, with many big things still in the pipeline.

                   Working in a small team of 3 software engineers, I have benefitted emmensely from the wealth of experience from our CTO and the opportunity to work on a wide range
                   of problems. I can honestly say I've learnt something new every single day since I've joined the software team - and I love the challenge. Getting to grips with the technical
                   skills was one thing, but making something work and writing good code are two very different things. Learning these skills under the guidance of our CTO is enabling us to build
                   more quickly and more reliably, which is a huge asset to such a small team.

                   The fully remote nature of the role means that all of this requires quality communication in order to make it a success. So while my work entails
                   communicating effectively with my team, it also involves relating what we are working to the wider company in a way that is accessible, understanding
                   their pain points to design new features with the tech team, providing timelines on the work etc - the link between tech and everyone else.

                <p class="hidden">
                  In a fast-paced early-stage start-up, everyone has to wear many hats. I've also found myself involved in onboarding new team members, shaping company processes,
                  influencing and making key decisions around the product's direction, joining meetings with the CEO and external stakeholders, including beta testers.
                  Through these experiences I've gained an holistic understanding of how various functions interconnect and contribute to the overall success of a company.
                  All in all, this hands-on journey has not only honed my technical skills but also cultivated my ability to adapt and innovate in dynamic environments,
                ensuring that I can contribute effectively across different facets of an organization.

              <p class="hidden">It wouldn't be a personal page without mentioning Gaelic football. I find myself seeking out a team everywhere I live -
                from county Roscommon (St Barrys) to Lyon (Lugdunum CLG), San Fransisco (Clan na Gael) and London (Tomás Mac Curtains).
                I've been lucky enough to represent all of these amazing clubs (as well as my home county and London) for many years. It's not just the winning matches in summer,
                it's the pre season running in wind and rain, the friendships, the 1 point All Ireland losses, the hard work, the team bonding, the dedication, the perseverance; I just love it all.
              </p>
              <p class="hidden">So much so that I've also volunteered within the GAA many times, be it helping to train or referee underage matches at my home club or at the CYC North
                American youth championships. Giving back to a community which has given me and others so much is something I feel very strongly about. My latest volunteering efforts
                have been with the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/storehouselondon/"> Storehouse Hackney food bank</a>; a wonderful organisation founded and led by Errol and Patsy Francis for over 14 years.

              <p class="hidden"> In a world filled with pain and suffering caused by atrocities like those in Gaza or Ukraine and hate-fueled

                sexual orientation (to name but a few), this quote has never been more true.  If we could learn to love like them, to see past our
                differences and embrace one another with the same warmth, we could begin to heal the wounds in our society and create a world where empathy and understanding prevail over hatred and division.

                That's why I also feel so lucky to have been trusted with so many pretty pooches during my dog sitting summer in San Fransisco!
